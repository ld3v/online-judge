# Submission
Solve problem -> Compile, run & test code with output -> Calculate SCORE and re-update submission result.

Have 2 method to add a new submission:
- Submit with code
- Submit with file

Basically, both methods are using the same scripts, flow to compile, run & test that code. The difference between them are:
- **With code**: after user submit to `@judge-api` -> Save this code to a file -> Run script with this file.
- **With file**: after upload this file to `@judge-api` -> Run script with this file.
